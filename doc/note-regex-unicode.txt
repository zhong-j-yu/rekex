high surrogate: U+D800 to U+DBFF
low  surrogate: U+DC00 to U+DFFF
surrogate pair: a high surrogate followed by a low surrogate,
                representing U+010000 to U+10FFFF
lone surrogate: a high surrogate not followed by a low surrogate,
                or a low surrogate not preceded by a high surrogate.
                it does not represent a unicode character.

Surrogate pairs are used in UTF-16; a lone surrogate in UTF-16 is invalid.
Now should a surrogate code point exist in input/output of UTF-8/32 encoder/decoders.
Unicode characters range from 0 to 10FFFF, minus the range from D800 to DFFF.

However, there is a great deal of tolerance of lone surrogates in various
Java APIs. Typically a surrogate pair is transformed to one valid character;
and a lone surrogate is also allowed as a code point of its own value.

In Java regex package, matcher apparently will convert input chars
into code points, tolerating lone surrogates. The code point sequence
will not contain a surrogate pair. Matching is done on code point level,
not char level.

The regex format also tolerates lone surrogates, e.g.
"\uD800", "\\uD800", "\\x{D800}", and they could match
lone surrogates in inputs.

Surrogate pairs like "\uD800\uDC00", "\\uD800\\uDC00" in regex
are transformed into an atomic character; they will not match
lone surrogates in inputs.

However, "\\x{D800}\\x{DC00}" is interpreted as two separate
code points; it could mean union or sequence, depending on context.
As a union it could match lone surrogates in inputs.
As a sequence, no, because inputs cannot have such sequences.

In our RegExp, we reject lone surrogates as Single or ends of Range.
Otherwise, we could construct a regex with a surrogate pair
from previously two separate constructs. We might be able to avoid that
by exploiting the \\x{} escapes, relying on the observation that
"\\x{D800}\\x{DC00}" is treated as two separate characters;
but that's not a documented behavior that we can rely on.

A range can still range over the surrogate region, e.g. [\u0000-\uFFFF],
which could match a lone surrogate in the input. Inputs should be
sanitized by clients to make sure there's no lone surrogates.

The Json grammar references a range of 0020-10FFFF. It's unclear
how it matches lone surrogates. Presumably they don't exist in inputs.

If a user attempts to use Java regex to match inputs as arbitrary 16-bit integers,
not as unicode characters, he's out of luck.
