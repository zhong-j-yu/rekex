# Rekex Specification 

This document specifies how Rekex maps datatypes to grammar rules.

## Annotated Types

In this document, datatypes are annotated-types of Java 17.
Types without annotations are also considered annotated-types.
Annotations mentioned are all type-annotations unless specified otherwise.
Annotations on a type is a *set*, with no ordering.  

An annotate type is one of
- a primitive type with zero or more annotations
- an array type with zero or more annotations, 
  and its component type is an annotated type.
- a class or interface type with zero or more annotations,,
  and its type arguments are annotated types.
  
Raw types and wildcards are not supported.

### Equality

Two annotated types are equal if they have the same syntactic form.
(Equality is not defined by mutual subtyping relationship.) 

### Subtyping

An annotated type `T` is a subtype of an annotated type `S`,
if 
- annotations of `T` is a super-set of annotations of `S`,

and one of the followings is true, 
- `T` and `S` are the same primitive type
- `T` and `S` are array types, and the component type of `T`
  is a subtype of the component type of `S`
- `T` and `S` are class or interface types
  of classes `Tc` and `Sc`,
  - `Tc` and `Sc` are the same class, and type arguments of `T` 
    are equal to type arguments of `S` 
  - `Tc` is a subclass of `Sc`, `Tc<params>` inherits from `Sc<f(params)>`,
    and `f(args)` is equal to the type argument list of `S`,
    with `args` being the type argument list of `T` 

For example, `@A1()LinkedList<@A2()String>` is a subtype of
`List<@A2()String>`.
  

## Grammar Rules

The following grammar rules may be derived by Rekex
- *Alternation Rule*, with zero or more subrules, ordered.
- *Concatenation Rule*, with zero or more subrules, ordered.
- *Repetition Rule*, with one subrule, and `min/max` cardinality.
- *Lookahead/Lookbehind Rule*, with one subrule.
- *Regex Rule*, with a `regex`, a `flags`, a `group` number.

Each rule is also associated with
- a unique`id`, which can be thought of as the terminal symbol.
- a `datatype` of the value to be produced if the rule applies.
- an `instantiator` that produces a value if the rule applies. 

The exact meaning of grammar rules are interpreted by the consumer of the rules;
a PEG parser generator will interpret them according to PEG semantics.

## Derive Grammar Rules from Datatypes

Given a target datatype, its corresponding grammar rule is derived
from following procedures, whichever succeeds first

- For each declared method in the "ctor catalog" class
  that is `public static`, annotated with `@org.rekex.spec.Ctor`,
  with 0 or more type parameters `{Ti}`, if there exists a unique
  substitution `{Ti:=Ai}` such that the method return type, with the substitution applied,
  is a subtype of the target type, the method is a "candidate ctor". 
  If there are one or more candidate ctors in the catalog for the target type,
  invoke subprocedure *derive_from_ctor_list* with these ctors. 
  
- If the target datatype is a `int, char, Integer, Character, String` type,
  and its annotations contains exactly one annotation that's convertible to 
  an `@org.rekex.spec.Regex` through AnnoMacro, return a *Regex Rule*,
  with `regex, flags, group` from the `@Regex` annotation.
  
- If the target datatype is a `java.util.List<E>` or `E[]`,
  return a *Repetition Rule*, with the subrule derived from `E`,
  with `min/max` derived from intersections of all `@org.rekex.spec.SizeLimit`
  annotations converted from annotations on the target type through AnnoMacro.

- If the target datatype is `org.rekex.spec.Peek<E>` or `org.rekex.spec.Not<E>`,
  return a *Lookahead/Lookbehind Rule*, with the subrule derived from `E`.
  
> The following clauses require that the target datatype is a class or interface type,
> or the procedure fails. The class or interface is referred to simply as *the class*.

- If the body of the class declares one or more "ctors",
  each ctor being either a public constructor, or a public static method,
  that is annotated with `@org.rekex.spec.Ctor`,
  invoke subprocedure *derive_from_ctor_list* with these ctors.

- If the class is an `enum` type, it must contain one or more constant fields;
  each field must contain exactly one annotation that's convertible to
  an `@org.rekex.spec.Regex` through AnnoMacro.
  The grammar rule for the `enum` type is an *Alternation Rule*, with
  each subrule as a `Regex Rule` referencing a constant field and its `@Regex` annotation.
  
  > It's possible that ctors are declared in the body of an enum type, 
  > in which case the previous clause precedes this clause.

- If the class is annotated with `@org.rekex.spec.Permits`,
  invoke subprocedure *derive_from_subclass_list*, with `value` of the `@Permits` annotation.
  
- If the class is a `sealed` type,
  invoke subprocedure *derive_from_subclass_list*, with classes in the `permits` clause.
  
- If the class contains exactly one public constructor, 
  and it contains at least one constructor parameter,
  invoke subprocedure *derive_from_ctor_list* with the constructor as the only ctor.
  
### subprocedures

- `derive_from_ctor_list(targetType, ctors)`
  - Order the ctors.
    A ctor is explicitly ordered if it's annotated with a `@Ctor`
    with a `value` other than `Ctor.ORDER_UNSPECIFIED`.
    If one ctor is explicitly ordered, all ctors must be explicitly ordered.
    If all ctors are explicitly ordered, they are ordered by their `@Ctor.value`.
    Otherwise, ctors are ordered by their line numbers in the source file.
  - For each ctor with with 0 or more type parameters `{Ti}`,
    there must exist a unique substitution `{Ti:=Ai}` such that the result type, 
    after the substitution applied, is a subtype of the target type.
  - Create a *Concatenation Rule* for each ctor, with subrules derived from
    types of the constructor/method parameters, with the substitution applied. 
  - The grammar rule for the target type is an *Alternation Rule*
    with subrules corresponding to the ctors.
    
- `derive_from_subclass_list(targetType, subclasses)`
  - Order the subclasses. If they are specified by a `@Permits` annotation
    in a `Class<?>[]`, the order is apparent.
    Otherwise, subclasses are ordered by their line numbers in the source file.
  - For each subclass `Cj<Ti>` with with 0 or more type parameters `{Ti}`,
    there must exist a unique substitution `{Ti:=Ai}`,
    such that the parameterized type `Cj<Ai>` is a subtype of the target type. 
  - For each subclass, derive a grammar rule from type ``Cj<Ai>``  
  - The grammar rule for the target type is an *Alternation Rule*,
    with subrules as those derived for the subclasses.
