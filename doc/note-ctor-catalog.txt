We want to express a production rule
    A -> B C
in Java, with Java types of A,B,C,
along with a code that constructs A from (B,C)

The most economical way is the record type

    record A(B b, C c){}

For more flexibility, one more more @Ctor methods can
be defined in the body of A.

    record A(B b) // don't store C
    {
        @Ctor public static
        A ctor(B b, C c){ return new A(b); }
    }

The long prefix `@Ctor public static` is annoying, but not by too much.

Ctors can be moved out to a central Ctor Catalog class

    public static class CtorCatalog
    {
        @Ctor public static
        A a(B b, C c){ return new A(b); }

        ... // others
    }

This may be because we do not want to, or cannot,
pollute AST types with syntax rules.

Another great reason is that all syntax rules are listed
in one place, so the grammar is defined in a single place.

We only look for ctor methods directly declared in the class,
not those inherited. It is difficult to define order
of methods from multiple classes.

--

Now, the long prefix `@Ctor public static` before every method in CtorCatalog
becomes even more distracting. Can we somehow omit them? Like,

    class CtorCatalog
    {
        A a(B b, C c){ return new A(b); }

        ... // others
    }

All non-private instance methods declared in the class are candidate ctors.
Again, no inheritance.
Use ordinary class; don't use `record` etc which may silently introduce instance methods.

We'll generate the parser code in the same package as the catalog class,
to access those package-accessible methods.
An instance of the class must be provided to PegParserBuilder,
or to the constructor of the generated parser code.
Different instances may have different behaviors in the ctors.

The first problem is that, builder.parser() loads the parser class
in its own class loader, preventing it from accessing those methods in CtorCatalog.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se16/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4
Two classes are not in the same runtime package if loaded from different class loaders.

User may declare these methods in an interface, so that they are implicitly public.
However there's no line numbers for bodiless methods, so we can't order them implicitly.
(default methods have bodies; but then the `default` prefix defeats the point)
Subclass needs to prefix these methods with `@Override public`, no good either
to use subclass as the catalog class.

Solution 1: require that these methods are public.
            a small nuisance, maybe. but if 1 word is fine, what's so wrong with 2?
            (implicit public methods in an interface with `@Ctor static`)

Solution 2: use builder only to generate the code, into the main src dir.
            invoke the parser constructor in production runs.
            two steps needed whenever grammar is changed.
            Not very friendly for development, especially for new users.

Solution 3: compile the class into the classpath of the application,
            use the same class loader to load the parser class.
            hackish, acceptable for development. not reliable.

Solution 4: parser code generated at compile phase (annotation processing)
            to be investigated. right now, not worth it just to fix this problem.

Solution 4: change the methods to public at class loading time with agent

Current decision:

Keep `@Ctor public static` as ctor marker in catalog.
Not too big a deal.
Might be nice to see explicit `@Ctor` markers.
Simpler. Consistent with ctors in datatypes.
`public` can be omitted on interface static methods.
